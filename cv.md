## Summary
Currently, I am working in the position of Director of the Latvian office of the British payment startup Dzing Finance. My duties include ensuring the office and its employeesâ€™ work and constant contact with Latvian state authorities, banks, legal, and accounting companies. In my work, I got interested in the creation of our developers and decided to dive deeper into this environment. I realized that I was more interested in Frontend development, so I decided to take a training course from RS School to determine my chances of entering the Frontend developer profession.
